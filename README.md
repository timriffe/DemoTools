# Tools for aggregate demographic analysis
Date: 2023-12-20

 
`DemoTools` is an R package that contains simple functions often used in demographic analysis. It is in active development. 

This project is commissioned by the [UN Population Division](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/) and financed by the [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/) as part of the [Making Family Planning Count](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/projects/making-family-planning-count/index.shtml) project. Work is also done in collaboration with Sean Fennell, [Jos√© Manuel Aburto](https://github.com/jmaburto), [Ilya Kashnitsky](https://ikashnitsky.github.io/), [Marius Pascariu](https://github.com/mpascariu), [Jorge Cimentada](https://github.com/cimentadaj), [Monica Alexander](https://www.monicaalexander.com/), and with minor contributions from [several more](https://github.com/timriffe/DemoTools/graphs/contributors) (thank you!). This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 IGO ([CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/igo/)). 

The idea behind `DemoTools` is to provide  a common set of functions that can be easily used by analysts and scientists working on demographic analysis and modeling.

## <i class="fa fa-arrow-alt-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> About top icons
If either of the first two icons at the top of this README are red, then the installation might not be working. You can assume we're fixing it. If they're green, then it should work.

Every time this repository is updated the entire code base is rebuilt on a server somewhere, and undergoes a series of checks. This happens on a Linux machine and on a Windows machine. Any warnings or errors in these builds will yield a red fail tag, and successes are green passes. Code coverage indicates what percentage of lines of code undergo formal unit testing of some kind.
