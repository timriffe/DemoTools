# TODO / wish-list
# [ ] All choice of Age_fit / AgeInt_fit based on criteria (see PJ Drive folder)
# [ ] ensure age groups are flexible as required.
#    [ ] what happens when one input is in a different age group than another?
# [x] OPAG_simple() should allow for non-single ages
# [ ] add unit tests
#    [ ] check for age group commensurability and warn if necessary
# [ ] add more examples to OPAG?
# [ ] remove rownames message from DownloadLx(), haha I DON'T SEE THIS
# [ ] test OPAG_simple() with non-single ages groups, update documentation if necessary.
# [ ] harmonize args betwenn OPAG_simple and OPAG family.

# [x] make AgeInt not required
# [ ] document Age_fit better
# [x] change open age formula in warp function
# [x] fix continuous = FALSE formula/ then removed 
# [x] ensure Lx is single ages once for use throughout 
# [x] change default method to "mono"

#' @param OAnow integer. The lower age bound above which counts will be redistributed
#' @param StPop numeric vector of standard population counts

#' Warps a given stationary population into a stable population

#' @details `Lx1` could be any population structure of any scale, as long as you're comfortable
#' assuming it's stationary and can be warped into stable. For the oldest ages, this is probably
#' quite often an acceptable and useful approximation. The transformation is applied at the single-age scale, even if the input `nLx` is in wider (e.g. abridged) age groups. When needed, we reduce to single ages using (default) `graduate_uniform()`, then apply the transformation, then group back. This is innocuous if `nLx` is given in single ages. You may want to change `method` to `"mono"` or `"pclm"`.

#' creates stable standard based on optimizing the growth rate
#' @description The stationary standard, `nLx` is transformed into a stable standard by optimizing a growth rate, `r` such that the stable standard matches observed population counts in selected age groups. Usually the ages used for fitting are wide age groups in older ages preceding the open age group. The standard output by this function is used by `OPAG` to create the standard used to redistribute counts over older age groups up to a specified open age group, such as 100.
#' @details The argument `method` don't have much leverage on the result. In short, the stable population transformation is done by ungrouping `nLx` to single ages (if it isn't already), and `method` controls which graduation method is used for this, where `"uniform"`, `"mono"`, `"pclm"` are the reasonable choices at this writing.
