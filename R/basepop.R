#' BPA and BPE methods for adjusting age groups under 10
#' @description Adjust population counts for the age groups 0 to 10
#'
#' @details
#'
#' \code{basepop_five} and \code{basepop_single} can estimate both the BPA and
#' BPE methods. If the user specifies \code{SmoothedFemales}, both
#' \code{basepop_*} functions will return the BPA method.
#' If \code{SmoothedFemales} is left empty, both \code{basepop_*} functions will
#' adjust using the BPE method.
#'
#' For \code{basepop_five}, adjusting the female population counts is the
#' default. For this, only the \code{location}, \code{refDate} and
#' \code{Females_five} are needed. All other arguments are downloaded
#' or set to sensible defaults. For adjusting the male population
#' counts, the user needs to specify the \code{Males_five} population
#' counts and set \code{female = FALSE}.
#'
# # For \code{basepop_single}, the same procedure applies. The only difference
# # is that the vector \code{Males_five} is named \code{Males_single} and accepts
# # a vector of single ages rather than five year abridged age groups. Similarly,
# # the vector for females is \code{Females_single} rather than
# # \code{Females_five} and accepts single age groups.
#'
#' Currently, \code{basepop_five} works only with five year abridged age groups
# #' while \code{basepop_single} works only with single year age groups.
#'
#' The BPE method is used by default. To adjust the counts using
#' the BPA method, the user needs to provide the \code{SmoothedFemales}
#' argument. This is the female population counts passed through
#' a smoothing function such as \code{smooth_age_5}. See the examples
#' section for some examples.
#'
#' @section BPA:
#'
#' Description:
#'
#' The method estimates a smoothed population ages 10 and over and adjusts
#' the population under age 10 using the smoothed population and estimates
#' of fertility and mortality.
#'
#' Based on the smoothed female population counts, it rejuvenates the female
#' "reported" population 20 to 59 years of age for the two 5 year periods prior
#' to the census date to represent the female population in reproductive ages
#' 5 and 10 years earlier.  Based on the rejuvenated population and fertility
#' and mortality levels, the method then estimates the male and female births
#' during the two 5 year periods prior to the census date. Next, it projects
#' the two 5-year birth cohorts to the census date. The projected figures
#' represent the adjusted population ages 0 to 4 years and 5 to 9 years
#' at the census date.
#'
#' Advantages:
#'
#' (1) The method adjusts under-10 population to be consistent with fertility
#' and mortality levels and adjusted adult female population.
#'
#' Limitations:
#'
#' (1) BPA assumes a linear change in fertility and mortality during the decade
#' prior to the reference year.
#'
#' (2) The procedure ignores migration, which can lead to misleading results.
#' There are two issues. First, age groups 0-4 and 5-9 are subject to migration,
#' which would affect the comparability of estimated and reported populations
#' in the base year.  Second, the estimated size of age groups 0-4 and 5-9 are
#' calculated from numbers of women of reproductive age in the base year
#' rejuvenated to points in the past.  With migration, rejuvenated number of
#' women may exceed or be smaller than the number present, and giving
#' birth to children, in the decade prior to the base year.
#'
#' (3) BPA’s smoothing calculations may mask unusual, but real, variations
#' in population age group size.  Smoothing irregularities in age structure
#' not attributable to age misreporting will distort estimated births and
#' survived children in the base year.
#'
#' Assumptions:
#'
#' (1) No significant international migration took place within the
#' reference periods for the population, mortality, and fertility input.
#'
#' (2) The data input as the "reported" population is not affected by
#' underenumeration of persons in certain ages, nor by age misreporting.
#'
#' @section BPE:
#'
#' Description:
#'
#' The method adjusts the population under age 10 using the reported population
#' ages 10 and above and estimates of fertility and mortality.
#'
#' The method rejuvenates the reported female population 20 to 59 years of age
#' for the two 5 year periods prior to the census date to represent the female
#' population in reproductive ages 5 and 10 years earlier. Based on the
#' rejuvenated population and fertility and mortality levels, the method then
#' estimates the male and female births during the two 5 year periods prior to
#' the census date.  Next, it projects the two 5-year birth cohorts to the
#' census date.  The projected figures represent the adjusted population ages
#' 0 to 4 years and 5 to 9 years at the census date.
#'
#' Advantages:
#'
#' (1) The method adjusts the under-10 population to be consistent with
#' fertility and mortality levels and adult female population.
#'
#' Limitations:
#'
#' (1) BPE assumes a linear change in fertility and mortality during the decade
#' prior to the reference year.
#'
#' (2) The procedure ignores migration, which can lead to misleading results.
#' There are two issues.  First, age groups 0-4 and 5-9 are subject to
#' migration, which would affect the comparability of estimated and reported
#' populations in the base year.  Second, the estimated size of age groups
#' 0-4 and 5-9 are calculated from numbers of women of reproductive age in
#' the base year rejuvenated to points in the past.  With migration, rejuvenated
#' number of women may exceed or be smaller than the number present, and
#' giving birth to children, in the decade prior to the base year.
#'
#' (3) The method does not adjust for possible underenumeration and age
#' misreporting errors in the over-10 “reported” population. If the
#' reported population is subject to age-misreporting or age-sex-specific
#' underenumeration, the over-10 population should be smoothed or otherwise
#' corrected prior to use.
#'
#' Assumptions:
#'
#' (1) No significant international migration took place within the reference
#' periods for the population, mortality, and fertility input.
#'
#' (2) The data input as the “reported” population is not affected by
#' underenumeration of persons in certain ages, nor by age misreporting.

#'
# #' `basepop_single` is used, the return value is a numeric vector with
# #' **single year age groups** where the counts between 0 and 10 are adjusted.
#'
#' @param location UN Pop Division `LocName` or `LocID`
#' @param refDate The reference year for which the reported population pertain
#' (these are the population counts in `Females_five` and
#' \code{Males_five}). Can either be a decimal date, a `Date` class.
#' If \code{nLxDatesIn} or \code{AsfrDatesIn} are not supplied and the
#' corresponding \code{nLxFemale/Male}/\code{AsfrMat} is not supplied,
#' \code{refDate} must be at a minimum 1962.5. This is because we can only
#' fetch WPP data from 1955 onwards, and these minimum date is assumed to be
#' 7.5 years before \code{refDate}, meaning 1955.
#'
#' @param Age integer vector of lower bounds of abridged age groups given in `Females_five` and `Males_five`.
#'
#' @param Females_five A named numeric vector with the population counts for
#' five-year abridged age groups for females in `refDate`. The names of the
#' vector should reflect the age groups. See the example section for some
#' examples.
#'
#' @param nLxFemale A numeric matrix. The female nLx function of two abridged life tables
#' with ages in the rows and time in columns. The earlier date should be at least
#' 7.5 years before the reference date of the "reported" population. The later
#' date should be no earlier than one-half year before the reference date of
#' the "reported" population. If not provided, it's automatically downloaded if
#' `location`, `refDate` and the equivalent population counts
#' `*_five` are provided.
#'
#' @param nLxDatesIn A vector of numeric years (for example, 1986). The dates
#' which pertain to the columns in `nLxFemale` and `nLxMale`. If not
#' provided, the function automatically determines two dates which are 8 years
#' before `refDate` and 0.5 years after `refDate`.
#'
#' @param AsfrMat A numeric matrix. An age-period matrix of age specific
#' fertility rates with age in rows, time in columns. If not provided, the
#' function automatically downloads the ASFR matrix based on the dates in
#' `AsfrDatesIn`.
#'
#' @param AsfrDatesIn A vector of numeric years (for example, 1986). These are
#' the dates which pertain to the columns in `AsfrMat`. If not provided,
#' the function automatically determines two dates which are 8 years before
#' `refDate` and 0.5 before `refDate`.
#'
#' @param ... Arguments passed to `\link{interp}`. In particular, users
#' might be interested in changing the interpolation method for the `nLx*`
#' matrices and the `Asfr` matrix. By default, it's linearly interpolated.
#'
#' @param Males_five A named numeric vector with the population counts for
#' five-year abridged age groups for males in `refDate`. The names of
#' the vector should reflect the age groups. See the example section for
#' some examples.
#'
#' @param nLxMale A numeric matrix. The male nLx function of two abridged life tables
#' with ages in the rows and time in columns. The dates which are represented
#' in the columns are assumed to be the same as `nLxDatesIn`. This
#' argument is only used when `female` is set to `FALSE` and
#' `Males_five` is provided. If `Males_five` is provided and
#' `female` set to `FALSE`, the `nLx` for males is
#' automatically downloaded for the dates in `nLxDatesIn`.
#'
#' @param SRB A numeric. Sex ratio at birth (males / females). Default is set
#' to 1.046. Only a maximum of three values permitted.
#'
#' @param SRBDatesIn A vector of numeric years (for example, 1986). Only a maximum
#' number of three dates allowed. These are
#' the dates which pertain to the values in `SRB`. If not provided,
#' the function automatically determines three dates which are 7.5 years,
#' 2.5 and 0.5 years before `refDate`.
#'
#' @param radix starting point to use in the adjustment of the three first age
#' groups. Default is NULL. If not provided, it is inferred based on the scale of age `1L0`.
#'
#' @param verbose when downloading new data, should the function print details
#' about the download at each step? Defaults to `TRUE`. We recommend the
#' user to set this to `TRUE` at all times because the function needs to
#' make decisions (such as picking the dates for the Asfr and nLx) that the user
#' should be aware of.
