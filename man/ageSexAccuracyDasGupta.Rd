\title{Calculate Ajit Das Gupta's (1995) age sex accuracy index}
\usage{
ageSexAccuracyDasGupta(Males, Females, Age, ageMin = 0, ageMax = max(Age),
  OAG = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Males}{numeric. A vector of population counts for males by age}

\item{Females}{numeric. A vector of population counts for females by age}

\item{Age}{integer. A vector of ages corresponding to the lower integer bound of the counts}

\item{ageMin}{integer. The lowest age included in calcs. Default 0}

\item{ageMax}{integer. The upper age bound used for calcs. Default \code{max(Age)}}

\item{OAG}{logical. default \code{TRUE}. Is the top age group open?}
}
\description{
Given population counts in 5-year age groups for males and females, follow Ajit Das Gupta's steps
 to calculate a composite index of the quality of the age and sex structure for a given population.
}
\details{
It is assumed that the terminal age group is open, in which case it's ignored.  Set \code{OAG = FALSE} if the top age is indeed a closed interval that you want included in calculations. If \code{ageMax == max(Age)} and \code{OAG} is \code{TRUE}, then \code{ageMax} gets decremented one age class.
