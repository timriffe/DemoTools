\title{Coale-Demeny a(0) as function of m(0), region, and sex.}
\usage{
lt_rule_1a0_cd(M0, IMR = NA, Sex = "m", region = "w")
}
\arguments{
\item{M0}{numeric. Event exposure infant mortality rate.}

\item{IMR}{numeric. Optional. {\ifelse{html}{\out{q<sub>0</sub>}}{\eqn{q_0}}}, the death probability in first year of life, in case available separately.}

\item{Sex}{character. \code{"m"} or \code{"f"}  for male or female,}

\item{region}{character. \code{"n"}, \code{"e"}, \code{"s"} or \code{"w"} for North, East, South, or West.}
}
\value{
The average age at death in the first year of life a(0).
}
\description{
Coale-Demeny a(0) from Manual X Table 164. This is a rule of thumb.
In this and some other older texts, a(0) is known as a 'separation factor'.
}
\details{
If \code{IMR} is not given, then \code{M0} is converted to q(0) using the following approximation:
\enumerate{
\item Find \eqn{\alpha , \beta}. Look up the appropriate slope and intercept for the given sex and region.
\item calculate \eqn{a} as: \ifelse{html}{\out{a = M<sub>0</sub> * &beta;}}{\eqn{a = M_0 * \beta}}
\item calculate \eqn{b} as:  \ifelse{html}{\out{b = 1 + M<sub>0</sub> *(1- &alpha;)}}{\eqn{b =  1 + M_0 * (1 - \alpha)}}
\item approximate {\ifelse{html}{\out{q<sub>0</sub>}}{\eqn{q_0}}} as:  \ifelse{html}{\out{q<sub>0</sub> = (b<sup>2</sup>- &radic; [b -4*a*M<sub>0</sub>]) / (2*a)}}{\eqn{q_0 = \frac{ b - sqrt(b^2 - 4 * a * M_0) }{ 2 * a } }}
\item use {\ifelse{html}{\out{q<sub>0</sub>}}{\eqn{q_0}}} as  IMR, and applied directly to the Coale-Demeny piecewise linear formula.
}

If \code{IMR} is given, then \code{M0} is disregarded, and transitivity is therefore not guaranteed. In this case, one has the option to use \code{lt_id_qm_a()} to derive \code{a(0)}, however discrepancies between these two parameters could force implausible results in \code{a(0)}, whereas the CD rule always gives something plausible.
