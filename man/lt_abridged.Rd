\description{
Given vectors for Deaths and Exposures, or Mx, or qx, or lx,
calculate a full abridged lifetable.
}
\details{
The main variations here are in the treatment of \code{nAx}.
In all cases, the lifetable is extended and closed out using one from a
selection of mortality age extrapolation methods implemented in the
\code{MortalityLaws} package rather than the common practice of taking
the inverse of the final \code{nMx} value (if it's an open interval).
For this, a desired open age must be specified, defaulting to the present
open age group, but which can not exceed 110 in the present implementation.
By default, the extrapolation model is fit to ages 60 and higher, but you
can control this using the \code{extrapFit} argument (give the vector of ages,
which must be a subset of \code{Age}). By default extrapolated values are used
starting with the input open age, but you can lower this age using the
\code{extrapFrom} argument. The \code{Sx} output column (survivor ratios)
is aligned with the other columns in all 5-year age groups, but note the
first two values have a slightly different age-interval interpretation:
In Age 0, the interpretation is survival from birth until interval 0-4.
In Age 1, it is survival from 0-4 into 5-9. Thereafter the age groups align.
This column is required for population projections.
