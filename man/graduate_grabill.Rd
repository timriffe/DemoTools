\title{The basic Grabill age-splitting method}
\usage{
graduate_grabill(Value, Age, AgeInt, OAG = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Value}{numeric vector, presumably counts in grouped ages}

\item{Age}{integer vector, lower bounds of age groups}

\item{AgeInt}{integer vector, age interval widths}

\item{OAG}{logical, default = \code{TRUE} is the final age group open?}
}
\value{
numeric vector in single ages.
}
\description{
This method uses Grabill's redistribution of middle ages and blends into
Sprague estimated single-age population counts for the first and final ten ages. Open age groups are preserved, as are annual totals.
}
\details{
Dimension labeling is necessary. There must be at least six age groups (including the open group). One year of data will work as well, as long as it's given as a single-column matrix. Data may be given in either single or grouped ages. If the highest age does not end in a 0 or 5, and \code{OAG == TRUE}, then the open age will be grouped down to the next highest age ending in 0 or 5. If the highest age does not end in a 0 or 5, and \code{OAG == FALSE}, then results extend to single ages covering the entire 5-year age group.

\examples{
a5 <- as.integer(rownames(pop5_mat))
p5 <- pop5_mat[,1]
p1g <- graduate_grabill(Value = p5, Age = a5, OAG = TRUE)
sum(p1g) - sum(p5)
p1s <- graduate_sprague(p5, Age = a5, OAG = TRUE)
\dontrun{
plot(seq(0,100,by=5),p5[,1]/5,type = "s", col = "gray", xlab = "Age", ylab = "Count")
lines(0:100, p1g, col = "red", lwd = 2)
lines(0:100, p1s, col = "blue", lty = 2, lwd =2)
legend("topright",
	lty = c(1,1,2),
	col = c("gray","red","blue"),
	lwd = c(1,2,1),
	legend = c("grouped","Grabill", "Sprague"))
}

# also works for single ages:
grab1 <- graduate_grabill(Value = pop1m_ind, Age = 0:100)
\dontrun{
plot(0:100, pop1m_ind)
lines(0:100, grab1)
}
