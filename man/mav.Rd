\title{Calculate the moving average (mav) over 3 or 5 years.}
\usage{
mav(Value, Age, n = 3, OAG = TRUE, tails = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Value}{numeric. A vector of demographic counts in single age groups.}

\item{Age}{integer. A vector of ages corresponding to the lower integer bound of the counts.}

\item{n}{integer. A single number, (often 3 or 5), indicating the number of years taken to smooth the population distribution by single ages.}

\item{OAG}{logical. Whether or not the top age group is open. Default \code{TRUE}.}

\item{tails}{logical. If set to \code{TRUE}, smaller-n moving averages are applied on both tails
such that all values are non-NA. If \code{FALSE} (default), tails are set to NA
due to the lag of moving averages.}
}
\value{
Vector with the smoothed demographic counts.
}
\description{
This arithmetic smoothing technique aims to eliminate irregularities of the population pyramid by averaging values in a moving window of user-defined width.
}
\details{
The moving window is applied symmetrically. By default (\code{tails = FALSE}) data endpoints are imputed with \code{NA}s in output: the is nothing under 0 or over the highest closed age group to average with. The open age group is not used in averaging, and it is returned as-is. Age intervals are assumed uniform. This function could be used with either single or 5-year age groups.

If \code{tails} is set to \code{TRUE}, then tails have been imputed using moving averages with successively smaller values of \code{n}, the cascade method.
