\usage{
interp_coh(
  c1,
  c2,
  date1,
  date2,
  age1 = 1:length(c1) - 1,
  age2 = 1:length(c2) - 1,
  lxMat = NULL,
  age_lx = NULL,
  dates_lx = NULL,
  births = NULL,
  years_births = NULL,
  country = NULL,
  sex = "both",
  midyear = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{c1}{numeric vector. The first (left) census in single age groups}

\item{c2}{numeric vector. The second (right) census in single age groups}

\item{date1}{reference date of c1`. Either a Date class object or an unambiguous character string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".}

\item{date2}{reference date of c2`. Either a Date class object or an unambiguous character string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".}

\item{age1}{integer vector. single ages of \code{c1}}

\item{age2}{integer vector. single ages of \code{c2}}

\item{lxMat}{numeric matrix containing lifetable survivorship, \code{l(x)}. Each row is an age group and each column a time point. At least two intercensal time points needed.}

\item{age_lx}{integer vector. Age classes in \code{lxMat}}

\item{dates_lx}{date, character, or numeric vector of the column time points for \code{lxMat}. If these are calendar-year estimates, then you can choose mid-year time points}

\item{births}{integer vector. Raw birth counts for the corresponding (sub)-population, one value per each year of the intercensal period including both census years. The first and last years should include all births in the given year; don't discount them in advance.}

\item{years_births}{numeric vector of calendar years of births.}

\item{country}{text string. The country of the census}

\item{sex}{character string, either \code{"male"}, \code{"female"}, or \code{"both"}}

\item{midyear}{logical. \code{FALSE} means all Jan 1 dates between \code{date1} and \code{date2} are returned. \code{TRUE} means all July 1 intercensal dates are returned.}

\item{verbose}{logical. Shall we send informative messages to the console?}

\item{...}{optional arguments passed to}
}
\description{
Cohorts between two censuses are interpolated flexibly using linear, exponential, or power rules. The lower and upper intercensal triangles are filled using within-age interpolation. This function is experimental and still in development.
