\alias{age_abridge_force}
\title{force a (count) vector to abridged ages}
\usage{
age_abridge_force(Value, AgeInt, Age)
}
\arguments{
\item{Value}{numeric vector, presumably counts in grouped ages}

\item{AgeInt}{integer vector, age interval widths}

\item{Age}{integer vector, lower bounds of age groups}
}
\description{
This is a robustness utility, in place to avoid annoying hang-ups in \code{LTAbr()}. If data are given in non-standard ages, they are forced to standard abrdiged ages on the fly. Really this should happen prior to calling \code{lt_abridged()}
}
\details{
This should be able to group up and group down as needed. \code{graduate_mono()} is used below the hood. \code{pclm()} or \code{graduate_uniform()} out to be flexible enough to do the same.

\examples{
V1        <- pop1m_ind
Age       <- c(0,1,3,seq(5,100,5))
AgeInt    <- c(1,2,2,rep(5,19),1)
Value     <- tapply(V1,rep(Age,times=AgeInt), sum)
