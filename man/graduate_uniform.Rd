\title{Convert arbitrary age groupings into single years of age.}
\usage{
splitUniform(...)

graduate_uniform(Value, AgeInt, Age, OAG = TRUE, OAvalue = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{extra arguments passed to \code{graduate_beers()} or \code{graduate_pclm()}}

\item{Value}{numeric vector, presumably counts in grouped ages}

\item{AgeInt}{integer vector, age interval widths}

\item{Age}{integer vector, lower bounds of age groups}

\item{OAG}{logical, default = \code{TRUE} is the final age group open?}

\item{OAvalue}{Desired width of open age group. See details.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of counts for single year age groups.
}
\description{
Uniformly splits aggregate counts in age groups into single year age groups.
}
\details{
Assumes that the population is uniformly distributed across each age interval, and that initial age intervals are integers greater than or equal to 1. If \code{AgeInt} is given, its final value is used as the interval for the final age group. If \code{AgeInt} is missing, then \code{Age} must be given, and the open age group is by default preserved \code{OAvalue} rather than split. To instead split the final age group into, e.g., a 5-year age class, either give \code{AgeInt}, *or* give \code{Age}, \code{OAG = TRUE}, and \code{OAvalue = 5}.
