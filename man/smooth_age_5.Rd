\description{
Smooth population counts in 5-year age groups using the Carrier-Farrag,
Karup-King-Newton, Arriaga, United Nations, Stong, or Zigzag methods. Allows for imputation
of values in the youngest and oldest age groups for the Carrier-Farrag, Karup-King-Newton,
and United Nations methods.
}
\details{
The Carrier-Farrag, Karup-King-Newton (KKN), and Arriaga methods do not modify the totals
in each 10-year age group, whereas the United Nations, Strong, Zigzag, and moving average (MAV) methods do. The age intervals
of input data could be any integer structure (single, abridged, 5-year, other), but
output is always in 5-year age groups. All methods except the United Nations and MAV methods
operate based on 10-year age group totals, excluding the open age group.

The Carrier-Farrag, Karup-King-Newton, and United Nations methods do not produce estimates
for the first and final 10-year age groups. By default, these are imputed with the original 5-year age group totals, but
you can also specify to impute with \code{NA}, or the results of the Arriaga or
Strong methods. If the terminal digit of the open age group is 5, then the terminal 10-year
age group shifts down, so imputations may affect more ages in this case. Imputation can follow
different methods for young and old ages.

Method names are simplified using \code{simplify.text} and checked against a set of plausible matches
designed to give some flexibility in case you're not sure

In accordance with the description of these methods in Arriaga (1994), it is advised to
compare the results from a variety of methods.
