\title{Updated Download or Process Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB)}
\usage{
downloadSRB(SRB = NULL, location = NULL, DatesOut = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{SRB}{Optional numeric value or vector specifying SRB(s) to use. If provided, this value is repeated for all \code{DatesOut}.}

\item{location}{Character or numeric code specifying the country or region for which SRB data should be downloaded.}

\item{DatesOut}{Numeric vector of years for which SRB values are required. Must contain at least one element.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, prints progress and diagnostic messages. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of SRB values for each year in \code{DatesOut}.
}
\description{
Retrieves country-specific Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB) data from the most recent installed \code{wpp} package
(e.g., \code{wpp2022}) or returns user-supplied SRB values for a specified set of years. If the requested
location is not found in WPP data, a default SRB value (1.0486) is used. Missing years are filled with the
mean of available SRB values.
}
\details{
The function identifies the latest installed \code{wpp} package (e.g., \code{wpp2022}) and extracts single-year
SRB data (\code{sexRatio1}). It supports both country names and ISO numeric codes as \code{location} inputs.

If the specified location is not found in the WPP data, a default SRB value corresponding to a sex ratio of
105 male births per 100 female births (\code{1.0486}) is returned. If certain requested years are missing from
the WPP dataset, the missing SRB values are imputed using the mean of available SRB values.

\examples{
# Example 1: Download SRB data for France
# lets try SRB 
SRB <- downloadSRB(SRB      = NULL,
                   location = "Argentina",
                   DatesOut = 1950:1952,
                   verbose  = TRUE)

# another setup for Spain
SRB2 <- downloadSRB(SRB      = NULL,
                    location = "Spain",
                    DatesOut = 2000:2030,
                    verbose  = TRUE)

SRB_user <- downloadSRB(SRB = SRB[1],
                       DatesOut = 1950)

The default proportion female at birth (\code{0.4886}), corresponding to \code{SRB = 1.0486}, is a widely used demographic constant commonly attributed to Keyfitz & Flieger (1971). This explains why the default value is not the rounded \code{1.05}.
